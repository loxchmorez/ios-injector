# iOS Injector Source Code
Since my friend andr released the source code of his iOS injector publicly, there's no point keeping mine private anymore. I developed my version four months earlier than andr's, so now sharing it openly.


## Background
This project is basically combind opainject and ChOma, created well before andr published his injection method. The decision to release the source follows the loss of privacy after his public upload. The code is messed up, but I don't really care as I don't even use it.

Proof from chat screenshots where I shared my source with some people.
