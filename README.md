# iOS Injector Source Code
Since my friend andr released the source code of his iOS injector publicly, there's no point keeping mine private anymore. I developed my version four months earlier than andr's, so now sharing it openly.


## Background
This project is basically a combination of opainject and ChOma, created long before andr published his injection method, which is better than mine. Furthermore, this app doesn't work with TrollStore because it uses setgid/setuid privilege escalation, which is prohibited in the SpringBoard app. The code is messy, but I don't care, since I don't even use it.


## Proofs

Proof from chat screenshots where I shared my source with some people.
